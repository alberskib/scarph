# property-less vertices

A model where only edges can have properties.

## what are properties

We start with a universe of types `V` that corresponds to the types that we can use as values for properties. For simplicity, keys are assumed to be `String`s; they could come from another universe `K` if needed.

The basic approach could be summarized as

- properties are defined independently of nodes, identified at the type level by a singleton type
- a key-value pair is encoded as the value type `V` tagged with the corresponding singleton type (shapeless records)

``` scala
case object name extends Property[String]
case object age  extends Property[Int]

val nm = name ->> "Alexey"
val ag = age ->> 135
val nm2 = name ->> "AtaÃºlfo"
val ag2 = age ->> 17
val nm3 = name ->> "Sigerico"

// optional: declare properties from literals
val dnm = "name" ->> "Unsafe"
val dag = "age" ->> 368
```

## declaring properties for edges

Edges are declared as singleton types, where the label comes from the `toString` method called on them (thus make them `case object`s).

``` scala
// the label = knows.label = knows.toString = "knows"
case object knows extends Edge {

  // this way you're forcing everyone to have at least the 'since' property on 'knows'
  implicit val since = this has since
}

// now somewhere else
case object score extends Property[Int]

// and at some other place
object ExtraStuff {

  implicit val knowsScore = knows has score
}
```

## assigning source and target to edges

This is done again through witnesses. Given the vertex types `user` and `org`, and the edge type `memberOf`,

``` scala
object OrgsGraph {

  implicit val umo = user -- memberOf --> org
}

// or use abstract modules
abstract class DeclareRel[
  N <: Vertex: Singleton#is,
  E <: Edge: Singleton#is,
  M <: Vertex: Singleton#is
]
(
  val source: N,
  val edge: E,
  val target: M
) 
{
  implicit val set = source -- edge --> target 
}
case object userMemberOfOrg extends DeclareRel(user, memberOf, org)

// somewhere else
object doSomething {

  import userMemberOfOrg._
  // do something
}
```

I think this is flexible enough, and with abstract modules could work well for what we want.
